Monty Hall started his career in Winnipeg in radio, moving to Toronto in 1946. Early in his career, Hall hosted game shows such as Bingo at Home on WABD-TV and guest-hosted more established game shows such as Strike It Rich on CBS.

He was the host/performer of two local New York City TV film shows for children: Cowboy Theater for WRCA (Channel 4) in 1956 and Fun In the Morning for WNEW (Ch. 5) in the early 1960s.

From 1956 to 1960, along with NBC Radio newsman, Morgan Beatty, Hall co-hosted the Saturday night segment of the NBC Radio Network weekend program Monitor from 8 p.m. until midnight (EST). At least one recording of Hall on Monitor is known to exist.[citation needed] He hosted the first show of his own, Keep Talking, in 1958.

Hall was a radio analyst for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League during the 1959 to 1960 season.

He succeeded Jack Narz as host of a game show called Video Village, which ran from 1960 to 1962 on CBS. From 1961 to 1962, Hall also hosted its spinoff, Video Village Junior, which featured children.

After moving to Southern California, Hall was the host of the game show Let's Make a Deal, which he developed and produced with partner Stefan Hatos.
