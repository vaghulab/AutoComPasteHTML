In 2010, Federer slowed down in his milestones and achievements. The year started with a win at the Australian Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final and extended his Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles, matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles.

At the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay. However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open, losing to Soderling in the quarterfinals and relinquishing his no. 1 ranking, having been just one week away from equaling Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as world no. 1. 

In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Tomas Berdych and fell to no. 3 in the rankings for the first time in 6 years and 8 months.

At the 2010 US Open, Federer reached the semifinals, avenging his French Open loss to Soderling in the quarterfinals, but proceeded to lose a five-set match to third seed Novak Djokovic.

Federer made it to four Masters 1000 finals, losing three of them (the Madrid Open, the Canadian Masters, and the Shanghai Masters), while winning the Cincinnati Masters against Mardy Fish.

In 2010, Federer equaled Agassi for the number of Masters wins at 17 and tied Bjorn Borg's mark for number of total titles won, moving to just one behind Sampras. Towards the middle of July, Federer hired Pete Sampras' old coach Paul Annacone on a trial basis to put his tennis game and career back on the right path.
