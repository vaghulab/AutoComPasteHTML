Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is an Indian cricketer widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of his generation. Born in Mumbai, he took up cricket at age of eleven, made his test debut against Pakistan at just sixteen years old, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for more than twenty years. 

He retired from the Indian Premier League in May 2013 and has announced that he will retire from the sport in November 2013 after playing his two-hundredth test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

He is the first player to score one hundred international centuries, the first player to score a double century in a One Day International, and thus far the only to complete 34,000 runs in international cricket.

In 2002, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest one-day-international (ODI) batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.

Tendulkar was a part of the 2011 Cricket World Cup winning Indian team in the later part of his career, his first such win in six World Cup appearances for India. He was also the recipient of Player of the Tournament award of the 2003 Cricket World Cup held in South Africa. 

In October 2013, he became the only Indian cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.
