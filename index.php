	color:#999999; font-family:Georgia;"><p><u><b>Experiment Instructions:-</b></u></p><p>Thank you for volunteering to participate in this research experiment! Given below are the instructions which you must follow in order to complete the experiment in a quick and efficient manner.</p>
	<p>1. Now that you are at the beginning of the experiment, the experiment conductor will now explain to you the goal of the experiment and the purpose behind it. You will also be played the video that is embedded on the website. This video would give you an introduction to the new copy-paste technique called as AutoComPaste and also guide you on how to use this technique. Added to this, you will also be given a few trial runs with this technique before we actually begin the experiment. Please feel free to clarify your doubts and make sure you are completely clear with what is going to happen.</p>
	<p>2. You will now have to fill up a consent form and a pre-experiment questionnaire which would help us gauge the participating audience in a better way.
	</p>
	<p>3. Now as you will see, you will first need to enter the participant ID as instructed by the experiment conductor in the text box on the screen and click on the start button.
	</p>
	<p>4. Once you click on the start button, you will be taken to the next page where you will have to enter a few pre-test demographic details consisting of your name, age and gender. You will also have to choose whether you agree to take part in this experiment. NOTE: Only if you choose yes, you will be able to move on to the next page.</p>
	<p>5. Once you click on the submit button at the bottom of the page, you will be asked to perform a series of experiments which would form the core of our experimental analysis. You will first be taken to the instruction page of one of the copy-paste techniques (the technique to be tested first is automatically chosen based on the participant ID). Given Below are the instructions for the respective Copy-Paste techniques.
	</p><hr/>
	<p><u><b>5.1 AutoComPaste</b></u></p>
	<p>a. The instructions for using this technique have already been covered by the experiment conductor at the beginning of the experiment. Now once you click on start, what you will see is a window divided into two parts.</p>
	<p>b. The upper section of the window shows you the specific instructions on the trial/task you have to perform. The lower section of the window consists of the working area where you would get your hands dirty.</p>
	<p>c. In the upper section, you would see a line which consists of several fields. These are the conditions under which a particular trial of the experiment is performed. For example, location of the text is a field which can take on three values - head, body, tail. Head refers to the first few paragraphs, the tail refers to the last few paragraphs and the body refers to the remaining paragraphs in the middle. You would be given a better idea about this when you perform the trial runs of the experiment.</p>
	<p>d. The lower section of the window consists of five smaller pop-up windows which you would be using as sources when you perform the AutoComPaste Copy-Paste functions.</p>
	
	<p>e. An example of an instruction would be to copy a sentence from one of the five windows and paste it in the text editor. This action should be performed using the AutoComPaste function. **IMPORTANT** Once you perform a copy-paste function, you will have to press the space-bar once so that the copy-paste function is completed. After this, you will have to delete the text from the text editor and then click on the 'Next Task' button on the top of the screen.</p>
	<p>f. After you complete all the instructions for this particular copy-paste technique, the experiment conductor would copy the results of the tests into a separate file and then would ask you to proceed to the next copy-paste technique testing if you haven't already performed it. </p>
	
	<p><u><b>5.2 Traditional Copy-Paste Method</b></u></p>
	<p>a. This technique is the normal copy-pasting method which you follow in your day-to-day life. You are free to use either Ctrl C + Ctrl V or right click copy-pasting. Now once you click on start, what you will see is a window divided into two parts.</p>
	
	<p>b. The upper section of the window shows you the specific instructions on the trial/task you have to perform. The lower section of the window consists of the working area where you would get your hands dirty.</p>
	<p>c. In the upper section, you would see a line which consists of several fields. These are the conditions under which a particular trial of the experiment is performed. For example, location of the text is a field which can take on three values - head, body, tail. Head refers to the first few paragraphs, the tail refers to the last few paragraphs and the body refers to the remaining paragraphs in the middle. You would be given a better idea about this when you perform the trial runs of the experiment.</p>
	<p>d. The lower section of the window consists of five smaller pop-up windows which you would be using as sources when you perform the Copy-Paste functions.</p>
	<p>e. An example of an instruction would be to copy a sentence from one of the five windows and paste it in the text editor. This action should be performed using the traditional copy-paste function. **IMPORTANT** Once you perform a copy-paste function using the traditional copy-paste technique, you will have to delete the text from the text editor and then click on the 'Next Task' button on the top of the screen.</p>
	<p>f. After you complete all the instructions for this particular copy-paste technique, the experiment conductor would copy the results of the tests into a separate file and then would ask you to proceed to the next copy-paste technique testing if you haven't already performed it. </p>
	<hr/>
	
	
	<p>6. Once you have completed both the experiments, you will reach the final page whereby you will have the option of downloading the result file. This will be taken care of by the experiment conductor.</p>
	<p>7. Remember that you are free to interrupt and ask questions at any point of time. The clearer you are, the more accurate the experiment results are!
	</p>
	<p>8. Finally, you will have to fill out a post-experiment questionnaire which would help us understand your preferences amongst the two copy-paste techniques in a better way. This would finally be followed by a small debriefing session which would end the experiment.</p>
	
	<p>Once again, thank you for choosing to participate in this experiment. All the Best &#9786;</p>
